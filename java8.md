## How will you call a default method of an interface in a class?

Using super keyword along with interface name.
```
interface Vehicle {
   default void print() {
      System.out.println("I am a vehicle!");
   }
}
class Car implements Vehicle {
   public void print() {
      Vehicle.super.print();                  
   }
}
```

## How will you call a static method of an interface in a class?
```
interface Vehicle {
   static void blowHorn() {
      System.out.println("Blowing horn!!!");
   }
}
class Car implements Vehicle {
   public void print() {
      Vehicle.blowHorn();                  
   }
}
```
The differences between default method and static method:
- Default methods can be overriden in implementing class, while static cannot.
- Static method belongs only to Interface class, so you can only invoke static method on Interface class, not on class implementing this Interface. In the above example, Car.blowHorm() is not valid.
- Both class and interface can have static methods with same names, and neither overrides other!

## What are functional interfaces?

Functional interfaces have a single functionality to exhibit. Java 8 has defined a lot of functional interfaces to be used extensively in lambda expressions.  
For example: 
```Interface Function<T,R>```  
This is a functional interface and can therefore be used as the assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference.
If you need refer a function by a variable, the variable need the type. Java defined a bunch of functional interface in the java.util.function package, one arguement, two argument, same return, different return or no return, or return boolean. 
This is actually the embarrassment to use functional programming in type restrict language. In javascript, you don't have this headache. 

## use AtomicReference to implement Lazy Initialization

```
public static <T> Supplier<T> lazy(Supplier<T> supplier) {
  val dummy     = new Object();
  val reference = new AtomicReference<Object>();
  return ()->{
    if (reference.compareAndSet(null, dummy)) { //compareAndSet means if reference == null then set it to be dummy
      try {

        val value = supplier.get();
        reference.set((Supplier<T>)(()->value));
      } catch (RuntimeException e) {
        reference.set(e);
      }
    }
    while (!(reference.get() instanceof Supplier)) {
      if (reference.get() instanceof RuntimeException)
        throw (RuntimeException)reference.get();
    }
    return ((Supplier<T>)reference.get()).get();
  };
}
```

## stream terminal functions vs intermediate operations
Stream operations are divided into intermediate (Stream-producing) operations and terminal (value- or side-effect-producing) operations. Intermediate operations are always lazy.  
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html 
Terminal operations include:
- forEach
- toArray
- reduce
- collect
- finAny or findFirst
- ...

## faltten nested collection
```
public <T> List<T> flattenListOfListsStream(List<List<T>> list) {
    return list.stream()
      .flatMap(Collection::stream)
      .collect(Collectors.toList());    
}
```

## collection groupby
https://www.baeldung.com/java-groupingby-collector


## Function.identity
```
Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("I", "love", "you", "too");
Map<String, Integer> map = stream.collect(Collectors.toMap(Function.identity(), String::length));
```
- identity is a static method on Function 
- It returns the input parameter

## Optional orElse vs orElseGet
orElse takes a default value as parameter 
orElseGet takes a function as parameter
orElseGet has better performance than orElse
// TODO

## Optinal or() Method 
Here is one example
```
Optional<Something> opt3 = opt1.or(()->opt2)
```
if opt1 is provided (not empty), opt3.get() is doing opt1.get()
if opt1 is not provided (empty), opt3.get() is doing opt2.get()
https://www.baeldung.com/java-9-optional

## Optional ifPresentOrElse() Method
We used to have code like this
```
if (a != null) {
   doSomething();
} else {
   doSomethingElse();
}
```
Now a is wrapped by an Optional<a>, how to implement the if...else... here. The method ifPresentOrElse() is created for this. The method ifPresentOrElse() has two consumer arguments, the first one is executed when the if condition is satisfied and the second one is executed when the else condition is satisfied.
```
optionalA.ifPrsentOrElse(
   () -> doSomething(),
   () -> doSomethingElse()
)
```
//TODO
what if it needs to return something 
```
if (a != null) {
   return 1;
} else {
   return 2;
}
```

## var to declare local variables

## get last element after split
```
String last = string.substring(string.lastIndexOf('-') + 1);
```

## Collections.synchronizedList() 
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#synchronizedList(java.util.List)  
Collections.synchronizedList() Returns a synchronized (thread-safe) list backed by the specified list. In order to guarantee serial access, it is critical that all access to the backing list is accomplished through the returned list.

It is imperative that the user manually synchronize on the returned list when iterating over it:
```
  List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList());
      ...
  synchronized (list) {
      Iterator i = list.iterator(); // Must be in synchronized block
      while (i.hasNext())
          foo(i.next());
  }
``` 
Failure to follow this advice may result in non-deterministic behavior.

https://howtodoinjava.com/java/collections/arraylist/synchronize-arraylist/
No explicit synchronization is needed to add, remove elements from synchronized arraylist.

I used to need call "contains" function. It actually needs to do the iteration inside the function, so it has to be in the synchronized block.

## java Volatile/synchronization on arraylist
Volatile on arraylist cannot make arraylist to be synchronized. 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32549628/java-volatile-synchronization-on-arraylist
The meaning of volatile is that changes made by thread A to a shared variable are visible to thread B immediately. Usually such changes may be in some cache visible only to the thread that made them, and volatile just tells the JVM not to do any caching or optimization that will result in the value update being delayed.

So it is not a means of synchronization. It's just a means of ensuring visibility of change. Moreover, it's change to the variable, not to the object referenced by that variable. That is, if you mark list as volatile, it will only make any difference if you assign a new list to list, not if you change the content of the list!

## spring jdbcTemplate to retrieve database auto-generated keys
https://www.logicbig.com/tutorials/spring-framework/spring-data-access-with-jdbc/key-holder.html

```
String sql = "insert into CUSTOMER (NAME, PHONE, ADDRESS) values (?, ?, ?)";
      KeyHolder keyHolder = new GeneratedKeyHolder();

      jdbcTemplate.update(
              connection -> {
                  PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(sql, new String[]{"ID"});
                  ps.setString(1, "Jake");
                  ps.setString(2, "234-333-627");
                  ps.setString(3, "345 Move Dr, Shine Hill");
                  return ps;
              }, keyHolder);

      Number key = keyHolder.getKey();
      System.out.println("Newly persisted customer generated id: " + key.longValue());
```

## create list with value

## SimpleDateFormat is not thread-safe
I used to work on a spring-batch project. Multiple threads read data chunk at the same moment and try to parse them. Somebody put the SimpleDateFormat as final static class variable. Under multiple threads, it throw some weird exception, like cannot parse the date.  
The solution is to move the SimpleDateFormat into method so it is not shared by different threads.

## parallelStream set thread number
```
txList.parallelStream().forEach(this::handleTx);
```
This code does the job in parallel stream. The threads number by default is processor number - 1.  
If you want to specify the thread number, the code is like this 
```
ForkJoinPool customThreadPool = new ForkJoinPool(10);
customThreadPool.submit(
         () -> txList.parallelStream().forEach(this::handleTx)
).get();
```
the .get() is to wait all parallelStream to complete.

## jdbc database deadlock exception takes long time
If deadlock happens on database side, it takes long time to return. In my test, it may take 10 seconds to return, depending on database setting.   
If we have the retry policy, we shall not wait that long. We shall fail the transaction and let it retry.  
In Sql server, the lock timeout of the session can be set like this 
```
SET LOCK_TIMEOUT 1000;  --set it to 1 second  
```

## parallel GC
I was facing some memory issue after running spring batch job to load big file into database. The allocated memory is much bigger then the memory is using.  
After investigating by jProfiler, I can see a lot of JDBC preparedStatement and parameter instances stay in memory. If I ran GC manually, the allocated memory shrined a lot, which means the objects are ready to be collected by GC.  
Adding the argument "-XX:+UseParallelGC" actually helps.  
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2101518/difference-between-xxuseparallelgc-and-xxuseparnewgc
- Apply -XX:+UseParallelGC when you require parallel collection method over YOUNG generation ONLY, (but still) use serial-mark-sweep method as OLD generation collection
- Apply -XX:+UseParallelOldGC when you require parallel collection method over YOUNG generation (automatically sets -XX:+UseParallelGC) AND OLD generation collection  
Here is the article help me to understand the connection leak
https://raul8804.wordpress.com/2019/03/31/spring-boot-project-db-connection-leak-investigation/
Eventually, I found this option "-XX:+UseSerialGC" works better.

## Future
https://www.baeldung.com/java-future  

the Future class represents a future result of an asynchronous computation â a result that will eventually appear in the Future after the processing is complete.  

To implement Future
```
public Future<Integer> calculate(Integer input) {        
   return executor.submit(() -> {
      Thread.sleep(1000);
      return input * input;
   });
}
```
To consume Future
```
while(!future.isDone()) {
    System.out.println("Calculating...");
    Thread.sleep(300);
}
 
Integer result = future.get();
```

## java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException
If there are a lot of async threads, you may see this exception. Basically it means the queue to receive the tasks is full and it rejects to receive new tasks.  
https://examples.javacodegeeks.com/core-java/util/concurrent/rejectedexecutionexception/java-util-concurrent-rejectedexecutionexception-how-to-solve-rejectedexecutionexception/  
For spring boot project, we can use this property to set the capacity
```
spring.task.execution.pool.queue-capacity= # Queue capacity. An unbounded capacity does not increase the pool and therefore ignores the "max-size" property.
```

## Get generic type of class at runtime
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3403909/get-generic-type-of-class-at-runtime
I don't like the way to pass in Abc.class through constructor. It seems redundant. For example
```
new MyClass<String>(String.class)
```
The suggestion from stackoverflow seems not working for me. I got exceptions. 
```
private Class<T> persistentClass;

public Constructor() {
    this.persistentClass = (Class<T>) ((ParameterizedType) getClass()
                            .getGenericSuperclass()).getActualTypeArguments()[0];
}
```
